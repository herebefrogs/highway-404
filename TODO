Ppl have said Highway 404 makes them think of Spy Hunter and Bump'n'Jump

game engine
===========

Post Compo

- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements
- ending: slow down highway, let the car continue offscreen
- nicer web page background
- mobile/touch area still too small on smartphone
- gamepad support?
- better music

- actually more challenges


- speed limiting doesn't slow down game time and can be abused for highscore (can't reproduce)
  -> should be a limiting coeff applied to elapsedTime passed to update() and render(),
     which code should be referring rather than accessing the global


OS 13k / in-game trophy
- Save winning the game as another trophy
- Save hitting all status codes (over time or in same game) as overachievers trophy

- procedural level generation <- hard one


- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.


build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
