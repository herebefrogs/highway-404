Ppl have said Highway 404 makes them think of Spy Hunter and Bump'n'Jump

game engine
===========

Post Compo
- better music
- add ZzFX death sound
- upgrade ZzFX Music
- Xem: voice localization fr/de/es/jp (and messages while we're at it)

- Animate daisies on the verges on title screen
- nicer web page background
- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements

- speech is annoying when triggering staggered status codes, play only once per code?
  - either speak the last message triggered, or speak the first, but the speech cue can get too long if driving on multiple codes quickly
      utterance.rate = 1.2; // speak 20% faster than normal
      // stop current spoken message and clear all cued messages, will lead to cut messages
      speechSynthesis.cancel();
      or 
      // if speechSynthesis.playing, skip new code to avoid cut messages
- sound menu

- speed limiting doesn't slow down game time and can be abused for highscore
  -> should be a limiting coeff applied to elapsedTime passed to update() and render(),
     which code should be referring rather than accessing the global


OS 13k / in-game trophy
- Save winning the game as another trophy
- Save hitting all status codes (over time or in same game) as overachievers trophy

- mobile
  - touch area still too small on smartphone
  - outline of virtual D-Pad when swipe starts to convey how to use the controls? (but your thumb is obscuring part of it, basically)
- gamepad support?


- actually more challenges
- procedural level generation <- hard one

- ending: slow down highway, let the car continue offscreen

- Straker/Nael: highway doesn't scroll; up/down actually accelerate/decelerate the car so players can take the problems as fast as they need
- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.


build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
